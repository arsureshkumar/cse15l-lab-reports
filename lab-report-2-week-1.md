## Installing VSCode

Start by going to [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and downloading Visual Studio Code.
Follow the installation instructions. Once the installation is complete, you should be looking at an image like this:

## Remote Connection

Go to [UCSD password reset](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

Enter username and ID number to find account.
Click "Reset Password" and follow the instructions thereafter. Make sure that the options to reset passwords for temporary accounts are also selected.

Wait 10-15 minutes for the password change to take effect. In the meantime, go to [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) and follow the instructions to install OpenSSH. Make sure to install just the client version, not the server version.

Once the password change has taken effect, go to Terminal -> New Terminal

In the new terminal, run `ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replacing `cs15lfa22zz` with your own specific account name.
